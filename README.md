# Don't Run Out Of Power

This game was created as part of the Gamedev.js Jam 2024. Theme was POWER. It is a prototype that could contain some bugs. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy playing it.

## DISCLAIMER

This is a copy of my private github repository for the game, in order to participate in the Open Source category.

I had to mask all graphical assets I used, because I bought them for commercial use. Check out the real game at [itch.io](https://nickhatboecker.itch.io/dont-run-out-of-power).

## About the Game

You wake up in a dark room. You can't remember how you got there. But fear pushes you forward. In the distance, you see a green light. The exit? Make your way through the dark obstacle course, but beware of the dangers lurking within.

Use night vision view to illuminate the path for a short time. However, once the battery is empty, you won't be able to use it anymore. So make sure you don't run out of power.

## How to play

- You can play with keyboard or gamepad.
- Walk with arrow buttons ← ↑ ↓ → or gamepad joystick.
- Toggle your night vision with X on keyboard or Xbox gamepad.
- Press P on keyboard or START on gamepad to open pause menu.
